Subject: [PATCH] FIX CVE-2018-10392

Taken from Subject: [PATCH] Sanity check number of channels in setup.
mapping0_forward in mapping0.c in Xiph.Org libvorbis 1.3.6 does not validate
the number of channels, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (heap-based buffer overflow or over-read) or possibly have unspecified
other impact via a crafted file.


Fixes #2335.
